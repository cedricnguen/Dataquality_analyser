# Dataquality_analyser
Data quality is becoming more and more of a concern for companies. The use of poor quality data in a data science, machine learning or business intelligence project could lead to a bad result and therefore negatively influence decision making.
For a dataset, it would be interesting to know in one click if the data is of good or bad quality through its accuracy. 
This mini-project allows to determine:
- The completeness rate: rate of missing values in the dataset
- The duplication rate
-The accuracy of the data: at what percentage the data is good.
When the completeness rate is different from zero, we propose an imputation of the missing values with the k-nearest neighbors algorithm(K-NN).
This project is interesting for biginners in data science.
